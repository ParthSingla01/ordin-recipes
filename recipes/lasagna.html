      <h2>Step 1</h2>
      <p>
        Cook ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high
        heat until browned and crumbled; drain excess grease. Stir in olives and
        water; season with minced garlic, oregano, onion flakes, garlic powder,
        pepper, sage, and basil. Simmer, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes.
        Stir in marinara sauce and remove from the heat.

      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>

      <h2>Step 3</h2>
      <p>
        Spoon a layer of meat and sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking
        dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta
        cheese over noodles; sprinkle with some mozzarella cheese. Cover with
        another layer of sauce; repeat layering, ending with meat and sauce on
        top. Reserve about 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Step 4</h2>
      <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, checking after 30 minutes.
        Lasagna is cooked when it's easily pierced with a knife. Sprinkle
        reserved mozzarella cheese over lasagna and bake until melted, about 10
        minutes more.
